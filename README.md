# Cystic-Fibrosis-Treatment-Response-Model
This model runs a McNemar's test on the Cystic Fibrosis genetic data input to yield a binary output (1-response found; 0-no response). It is the foundation of a predictive model to detect the responsiveness of Cystic Fibrosis patients (particularly those with the F508Del mutation) to the Trikafta Treatment. The model found an ~85% accuracy.
